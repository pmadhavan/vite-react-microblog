# vite-react-microblog

### Summary

This is small challenge to practice react basics such as builtin hooks and fetching data from server. The challenge mimics a blogging app with posts. The task can be practiced in phases,
Phase 1: Render the page with static data
Phase 2: Add a form to create a posta nd add to the existing list
Phase 3: Replace the static data with the dynamic data from server
